Each item has 1/(maxWeight - weight)^granularity chance to be in the instance for heavier things and 1/weight^(-granularity) for lighter things, where maxWeight = sum of weights. WARNING!!! for realy high numbers(or really low for lighter things) the generation take a lot of time because most things will be thrown away. So for best result use number between <-1, 1>. For 0 the generating is random.'\",\n                          modifiers: { right: true }\n                        }\n                      ],\n                      staticClass: \"form-tooltip\"\n
