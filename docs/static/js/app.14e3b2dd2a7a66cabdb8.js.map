Each item has 1/(maxWeight - weight)^granularity chance to be in the instance for heavier things and 1/weight^(-granularity) for lighter things, where maxWeight = sum of weights. WARNING!!! for realy high numbers(or really low for lighter things) the generation take a lot of time because most things will be thrown away. So for best result use number between <-1, 1>. For 0 the generating is random.'\",\n                          modifiers: { right: true }\n                        }\n                      ],\n                      staticClass: \"form-tooltip\"\n                    },\n                    [\n                      _c(\"span\", {\n                        staticClass: \"glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign\"\n                      })\n                    ]\n                  ),\n                  _vm._v(\" \"),\n                  _c(\"input\", {\n                    directives: [\n                      {\n                        name: \"model\",\n                        rawName: \"v-model\",\n                        value: _vm.generatorParams[2].granularity,\n                        expression: \"generatorParams[2].granularity\"\n                      },\n                      {\n                        name: \"validate\",\n                        rawName: \"v-validate.initial\",\n                        value: {\n                          required: true,\n                          min_value: -10,\n                          max_value: 10,\n                          regex: /^-?\\d+\\.?\\d*$/\n                        },\n                        expression:\n                          \"{ required: true, min_value: -10, max_value: 10, regex: /^-?\\\\d+\\\\.?\\\\d*$/ }\",\n                        modifiers: { initial: true }\n                      }\n                    ],\n                    staticClass: \"form-control\",\n                    attrs: {\n                      type: \"number\",\n                      id: \"KnapgenParam5\",\n                      placeholder: \"\",\n                      name: \"granularity\",\n                      \"data-vv-as\": \"granularity\"\n                    },\n                    domProps: { value: _vm.generatorParams[2].granularity },\n                    on: {\n                      input: function($event) {\n                        if ($event.target.composing) {\n                          return\n                        }\n                        _vm.$set(\n                          _vm.generatorParams[2],\n                          \"granularity\",\n                          $event.target.value\n                        )\n                      }\n                    }\n                  }),\n                  _vm._v(\" \"),\n                  _c(\n                    \"span\",\n                    {\n                      directives: [\n                        {\n                          name: \"show\",\n                          rawName: \"v-show\",\n                          value: _vm.errors.has(\"granularity\"),\n                          expression: \"errors.has('granularity')\"\n                        }\n                      ],\n                      staticClass: \"help-block\"\n                    },\n                    [_vm._v(_vm._s(_vm.errors.first(\"granularity\")))]\n                  )\n                ]\n              )\n            ])\n          : _vm._e(),\n        _vm._v(\" \"),\n        _vm.selectedProblemId === 3\n          ?
